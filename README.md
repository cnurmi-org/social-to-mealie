# Social Media to Mealie

Have you found a recipe on social media and don’t want to write it out yourself? This tool lets you import recipes from
videos directly into [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie).

## Quick Start

```bash
make init
cp .env.example .env
make run
```

## Workspace Commands

```bash
make help
make check
make deploy
```

`make check` runs the safe local validation path for this repo: lint plus a production build.

## Dev Container

This repo now includes a devcontainer at [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](/home/cnurmi/repo/social-to-mealie/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

It is intended for reproducible development on `devbox` or in a remote container-capable editor. The devcontainer installs the Node 22 toolchain plus `ffmpeg` and `python3`, then seeds `.env` from `.env.example`.

Typical flow:

```bash
make init
make check
make run
```

The production Docker image and deployment path are unchanged.

**Tested social media platforms:**

- Instagram
- TikTok
- Facebook
- YouTube Shorts
- Pinterest

Other sites may work as well, since the tool uses `yt-dlp` to download videos. If you encounter issues with other
websites, please open an issue.

> **Note:** If you receive a `BAD_RECIPE` error, it may be due to Mealie’s recipe parsing. If you find a better prompt
> or solution, feel free to open an issue or PR!

## Features

- Import posts into Mealie with a link and a click
- [iOS Shortcut v0.3](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3778d926ed794dca95e658c6a4b5cf11) for easy importing

## Tested AI providers compatibility:

- OpenAI
- GroqAI

## Partial support:

Because theese providers don't support the transcriptions API it requires LOCAL_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL to be set, recommended model: `Xenova/whisper-base`, you can use any model that is compatible with the ONNX runtime from hugging face

- llmstudio
- ollama

I can work with any other provider that is compatible with the OpenAI API, if you find any issues please open an issue.
